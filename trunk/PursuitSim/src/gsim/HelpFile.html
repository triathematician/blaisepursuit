      <h3>Agents</h3>

      <p>
          Agents are the basic unit in a pursuit simulation. They have individualized
          behaviors and can be customized in several ways. Their basic parameters are:
      </p>
      <ul>
          <li><b>Initial Position</b>: Location at which the agent starts.</li>
          <li><b>Top Speed</b>: The maximum speed achievable by the agent.</li>
          <li><b>Max Acceleration</b>: The maximum rate at which the agent's speed can increase.</li>
          <li><b>Turning Radius</b>: The minimum radius at which the agent can turn. If 0, the agent can turn in any direction at any time.
              Otherwise, the agent will be unable to travel in a tighter circle than one of this radius.</li>
          <li><b>Communications Radius</b>: This is the maximum range at which the agent can send communications.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
          Agents also support more complex attributes and behaviors.
      </p>
      <p>
          An agent's path is determined by a single <i>main task</i>, which includes information
          about the position (and velocity) of some sort of target. This may represent an actual
          target, or it might represent a "phantom" target, e.g. if an evader is trying to escape
          from two pursuers. The agent will move as close to the target as possible, subject
          to the restrictions imposed by its <i>max acceleration</i> and <i>turning radius</i>.

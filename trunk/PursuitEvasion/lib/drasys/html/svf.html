SVF - Simple Vector Format</h1></center>

<hr WIDTH="100%">
<p>An <b>SVF</b> stream contains two types of records, a <b>size</b> record
and an <b>element</b> record<b>. </b>The size record contains the length
of the vector and the element record contains the index and value for one
element. The stream can contain multiple input vectors where each vector
is defined by a size record followed by its element records. The size record
is optional for the first vector.
<p>A <b>size</b> record has one white-space delimited integer field. The
field holds the number of elements in the vector. The size record if present
must precede the element records for a vector.
<p>An <b>element</b> record has three white-space delimited fields. The
first is integer and holds index. The second field&nbsp; holds the real
part of the element. The third field is optional and hold the imaginary
part of the element.
<p>A any line with a leading '#' is taken as a <b>comment</b> and ignored.
<p>Here is an example SVF input stream:
<p># -------------------------------
<br># The first vector - dense 4
<br># -------------------------------
<br>4
<br>0&nbsp; 2.3
<br>1&nbsp; 4.5&nbsp; 3.6
<br>2&nbsp; 5.8
<br>3&nbsp; 0.0&nbsp; 4.3
<p># --------------------------------------
<br># The second vector - sparse 100
<br># --------------------------------------
<br>100
<br>&nbsp; 0&nbsp; 34.6&nbsp; 0.5
<br>55&nbsp; 49.0&nbsp; 3.1
<br>99&nbsp; 32.4
<br>18&nbsp; 32.8

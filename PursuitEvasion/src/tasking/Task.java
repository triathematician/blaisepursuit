/**
 * Contains a task, whose object is some target agent. The target be a stationary goal, a moving
 * player, or some other kind of point (e.g. center of mass of a team). The task also has
 * a priority level (between 0 and 1), and a boolean describing whether the player should
 * seek or flee the target. End behaviors will usually arise based on a combination of different
 * tasks with different priority levels. Tasks will be assigned by either a single player, a team
 * control element, or by communication between players. These are done using the Autonomous class,
 * the Control class, and the Cooperation task, respectively.
 * <br><br>
 * Eventually, this class will also implement <i>cooperative tasks</i>. As an example, two players
 * might want to work together to surround a second player. As there is still a single target player,
 * however, this can currently be implemented with identical tasks between the players and an agreement
 * to carry out a "Surround" behavior.

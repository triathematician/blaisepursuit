= Iteration Structure Steps =
Generally speaking, pursuit/evasion algorithms between multiple players contain three steps: MTT (multiple target tracking), PEA (pursuer-evader assignment), and PP (path planning). These are all implemented in the steps of the main iteration of the pursuit simulation.

 # Recompute distances between all players (stored in *DistanceTable* class)
 # Check for any captures that may have occurred (as registered by a *CaptureCondition* class)
  * If any captures occur, possibly remove players from the field and log a *SignificantEvent*.
 # Check for any "victory" that has occurred (as registered by a *VictoryCondition* class).
  * If victory states flip, log a *SignificantEvent* and quit simulation.
 # Multiple target tracking (MTT)
  * Players sense their environment
  * Players communicate with teammates about what they see.
  * Players "fuse" their own perceptions with those communicated by others.
 # Tasking / Pursuer-Evader Assignment (PEA)
  * "Control agent" generates tasks for all teammates
  * Individual agents generate tasks for all teammates
 # Task Fusion / Path Planning (PP)
  * Players turn the list of tasks they have into a DIRECTION in which they can travel
  * Use a *Behavior* to determine how to fuse the tasks together
  * Move all players
